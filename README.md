# Stock Market Analysis - VBA

Created a script that looped through all the stocks for every worksheet, every year and took the following information:
- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- The total stock volume of the stock

The script has conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red. It also returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
